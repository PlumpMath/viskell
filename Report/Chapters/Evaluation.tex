\section{Process}

On the technical tools side, none of the members on the team had extensive experience with git \emph{and} GitHub \emph{and} Maven \emph{and} Travis, and some had never used either. It took quite a while for some to `get' the proposed workflow, and there was a lot of friction, many hours lost, and some frustration with those who struggled. Presentations on the subject helped, but some friction remained.

On a few occasions, we had difficulties planning sprints. Sprint goals and requirements either turned out to be vague at the end of the sprint, making it unclear or disputed whether or not we had completed them, or the goals were missed altogether.
