\chapter{Recommendations}
\index{recommendations}

Wile working on this project we came up with a lot of ideas.
Sadly, a large number of these ideas were too big or too complicated to be included in this project.
However, future developers might find these ideas useful as inspiration.

We have compiled a wish list of the features we would like to see in Viskell:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Circular menu (see \ref{circular_menu} on page \ref{circular_menu}).
	\item Compact view of functions (for large programs).
	\item Support for more Haskell functions (e.g. I/O).
	\item Support for explicit recursion and pattern matching.
	\item The ability to input Haskell code and/or loading Haskell code.
	\item Undo and redo.
	\item Save and load programs.
	\item Larger canvas (currently not possible due to an issue with OS X).
	\item Search functions in menu.
\end{itemize}
